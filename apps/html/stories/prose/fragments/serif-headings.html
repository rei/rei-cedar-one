    <h1>Field journal: early season snowfall</h1>
    <p>
      Serif headings provide a warmer, more expressive tone while the body
      copy remains sans for readability. This combination works well for
      editorial or brand storytelling content.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Light snow fell overnight above 6,500 feet, with a thin crust lingering
      on shaded slopes. South-facing sections remain mostly clear.
    </p>
    <h3>Notes from the crew</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Expect soft footing after noon as temperatures rise.</li>
      <li>Microspikes recommended for shaded switchbacks.</li>
      <li>Carry extra layers for exposed ridgelines.</li>
    </ul>

        We’re seeing the first hints of winter, but most lower trails are still
        in excellent shape.
