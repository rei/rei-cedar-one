# Cedar One

Cedar One is the unified foundation of the [Cedar design system](https://cedar.rei.com).
It defines a single, token-driven source of truth from which all Cedar styles and behaviors are derived.

By resolving design decisions at build time instead of runtime, Cedar One delivers smaller bundles, simpler integration, and consistent parity across web and native platforms.

## Why Cedar One

- **One system, many surfaces:** a single token source drives consistent outputs for web and React Native.
- **HTML-first by default:** components resolve to native markup and static CSS wherever possible.
- **Minimal runtime:** behavior is layered intentionally, not assumed.
- **Framework-agnostic:** styles and patterns work across Vue, React, and plain HTML.
- **Optimized delivery:** optional on-demand utilities (via UnoCSS) alongside prebuilt CSS.
- **Built for authoring:** contracts are enforced at development time through linting and tooling.
